Summary
---------
I’m a full stack software developer with 10+ years experience, primarily focused on mobile solutions, 
web based and API’s. I was fortunate to be surrounded by a team of talented developers and 
exposed to the Full Stack and Agile project management. Beginning projects at the initial 
requirements gathering stage, taking them through the design process, and bringing them to 
public release. Capacity to think outside of the box and take initiatives to provide improvements 
to product, projects and processes. Really passion to think on the overall solution rather than just code.
